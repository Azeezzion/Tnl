GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [cli.denominionet@gmail.com](https://github.com/cli.soft.denominionet@gmail.com).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in GitHub CLI, you can report it to us in one of two ways:

* Report it to this repository directly using [private vulnerability reporting][soft]. Such reports are not eligible for a bounty reward.
